File-TVShow-Organize version 0.360.1 / 0.36.1
============================

This module makes it easier to move TV Show files into the correct Show
folder and also place them in to the correct season or specials folder.
This may be of use if you have a large media server which you are trying to
keep organised.

It might also be used to move files into season folders if you have merely
dumped these files into a single folder in the beginning.
