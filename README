Video-File-TVShow-Import version 0.31
============================

This module makes it easier to import TV Show files into the correct Show folder and also
place them in to the correct season or specials folder. This may be of use if you have
a large media server which you are trying to keep organised.

It might also be used to move files into season folders if you have merely dumped these files into a single folder in the
beginning.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make

Example Usage:
