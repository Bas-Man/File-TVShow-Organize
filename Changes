		a new Object.

	- Implemented recursive processing in processNewShows(); This can be enabled
		by calling $obj->recursion(1)

0.35
	- No functional changes. This release is part of getting the module to passed
	CPAN tester tests.

0.36
	- Added tests to ensure that we can find 'rsync' if we are not able to finds
	this command. We abort any further tests and will not install. This should
	help with some of the CPAN testers.
	- Started using IPC::Cmd to determine if we can find and use 'rsync' command.
